# This code for edit use it with UPSTREAM_REPO.

### Update
- `UPSTREAM_REPO`: Your github repository link, if your repo is private add `https://username:{githubtoken}@github.com/{username}/{reponame}` format. Get token from [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). So you can update your bot from filled repository on each restart. **NOTE**: Any change in docker or requirements you need to deploy/build again with updated repo to take effect. DON'T delete .gitignore file. For more information read [THIS](https://github.com/codewithweeb/mirror-with-weeb#upstream-repo-recommended).
- `UPSTREAM_BRANCH`: Upstream branch for update. Default is `update`. (don't ever fill heroku here)

The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart (use /restart command to restart the bot).
